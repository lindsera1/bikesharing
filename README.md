# Overview of the analysis

Our investor are eager to set up a citi bike business in the small town of Des Moines, Iowa and looked to me and my Tableau expertise to provide visualization and 
insight into the potential for setting up the business there, based on info from New York. We looked at several parameters, from when rides were most frequent, how rides were different between 
genders,when the best time for bike repairs would be, and even how subscription status affected usage rate. Every one of these were visualized in a way that was 
easy for the investors to read, and they were pleased with the results, as shown below.

+ In our first visualization, we can see the rise and fall of bike rides during peak and slow hours. The peak hours occured between 5 to 7 PM then we can see
a steady decline after those times

+ In our second visualization, we looked a little deeper into the same info as visualization one, but separated the rides out by gender. Males were the predominate
group of riders throughout all of New York.

+ We used a heat map for the third visualization to get an idea of which days of the week, as well as the time of the day, were most greatly affected by the riders.
Weekdays seemed to be the busiest time. 

+ The fourth visualization also used a heat map, but we also looked at distinctions between genders and which rode bikes more often. It seems the gender didn't 
affect the ration of riders at all, rather just the number of riders. For example, both males and females rode more often at 5 PM than they did at 5 AM. 

+ The fifth visualization kept the groups separated by gender, but looked at the extra dimension of user type, whether they were a subscriber or just a casual user.
It does appear that subscribers use the bikes far more often than the casual customer. 

# Summary 

In the final analysis, we can say that this visualization shows that male subscribers at 5 to 7 PM are the heaviest users of this service, and will probably 
comprise the majority of the customer base if our investors were to set up shop in Des Moines, Iowa. On the other hand, I'm no statistician but comparing a town of
population of 200,000 to a city of 8.5 million seems a little off; the commuter culture is entirely different. Most people don't have cars in New York, and Des 
Moines is not that type of city. The predominate use of rentable bikes to me seems to quickly and efficiently get from point a to point b; that could possibly be 
done much better in a car than using a bike in Des Moines. If I was the investors, I would look at how the commute culture works in the desired city to set up shop;
how are people using other ride sharing services? What would be a popular area to provide bikes if so?
